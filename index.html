        <p>I'd like to make a short display of the skills I've learned with CSS, while showing you cat pictures!</p>

    <div class="background-happy-cat" >
        <p>Here we shall show you a happy cat. This is a terrible image to use as a background, as it has a lot going on and makes it sort of hard to read the text.</p>
        <p>Hmmm...</p>
        <p class="bigger-text">Maybe I'll just make the text bigger</p>
        <p id="red-text">Make the text red too?</p>
        <p id="font-family">Nope that was awful..Lets try this font-family instead</p>
        <p class="bigger-text">Well... At least we got to see a nice happy cat. Moving on...</p>

    <div class="background-angry-cat">
        <p><b>Here is an angry cat. Twice because we love him.</b></p>

    <div class="background-cute-cat">
        <p id="white-text">Finally a cute cat. He is large because he is 1280pixels.</p>
